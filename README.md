### About

* Employee Directory is an application for quickly viewing employee contact information.

* An employee or manager would benefit greatly from being able to view non-sensitive data about other employees. It would be particularly helpful to be able to filter employees by name.

* Employees can be listed in alphabetical order by last name in either ascending or descending order.

* Employees can be search for by first or last name.

### User Story

    AS A user, I want to be able to view my entire employee directory at once so that I have quick access to their information.

### Build

* In HTML, semantic tags have been used to aid with accessibility.
* The site is built using a Bootstrap CSS framework.
   * The use of Bootstrap minimises the need for media queries. 
   * See [Bootstrap documentation](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.6/getting-started/introduction/) for more information.
* [randomuser.me](https://randomuser.me/) provides the random employee data.
